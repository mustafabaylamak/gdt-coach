# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Current state

Sprint 1: the domain model layer (`gdt_coach.models`) is implemented.
There is still no parsing and no rule engine — the models are inert
data containers with only enough validation to reject structurally
impossible data.

## Layout

- `src/gdt_coach/` — the installable package (src layout, keeps the
  package importable only from its installed form, avoiding accidental
  imports from a repo-root copy).
  - `models/` — Pydantic domain models (`Drawing`, `Feature`, `Datum`,
    `Dimension`, `FeatureControlFrame`, `Tolerance`, and their
    enumerations). See "Domain model" below.
- `tests/` — pytest suite, mirrors the package layout (`tests/models/`
  mirrors `src/gdt_coach/models/`).
- `docs/` — project documentation beyond the top-level `*.md` files.
- `scripts/` — one-off or maintenance scripts not part of the package.

## Domain model

`gdt_coach.models` holds the GD&T domain shape as Pydantic v2 models,
based on ASME Y14.5 concepts:

- `Drawing` — aggregate root: title/number/revision/default unit, plus
  the `Feature` and `Datum` collections. Rejects duplicate feature ids
  and duplicate datum labels within the same drawing.
- `Feature` — a physical feature of a part (hole, slot, pin, ...),
  holding its own `Dimension` and `FeatureControlFrame` lists.
- `Datum` — a lettered datum feature reference (`A`, `B`, ...) and the
  geometric type it simulates (plane, axis, point, line, center plane).
- `Dimension` — a nominal value with a unit and an optional `Tolerance`
  (absence of a tolerance means the dimension is basic/theoretically
  exact). Cross-checks type/unit/value consistency (e.g. an angular
  dimension must use degrees; a diameter must be positive).
- `FeatureControlFrame` — characteristic symbol + `Tolerance` + ordered
  `DatumReference` list (a small nested model pairing a datum label
  with its own material condition modifier), plus common frame
  modifiers (`all_around`, `all_over`, `free_state`,
  `statistical_tolerance`).
- `Tolerance` — shared by `Dimension` (a size tolerance range) and
  `FeatureControlFrame` (a geometric tolerance zone, represented as
  `upper_deviation == lower_deviation`), plus zone shape, material
  condition, and optional projected-zone height.
- `enums.py` — `GeometricCharacteristic` (the 14 ASME symbols),
  `MaterialCondition`, `DatumFeatureType`, `FeatureType`,
  `DimensionType`, `ToleranceZoneShape`, `Unit`. All are `enum.StrEnum`.

All models inherit `GDTBaseModel` (`models/base.py`), which forbids
unknown fields and re-validates on attribute assignment
(`extra="forbid"`, `validate_assignment=True`).

### Validation philosophy

Model validators only reject data that is *structurally impossible*
(negative tolerance, a diameter of zero, duplicate datum labels,
mismatched dimension type/unit). They never encode GD&T interpretation
rules (e.g. "flatness cannot reference a datum") — that belongs to a
future rule engine that operates on a fully-assembled `Drawing`.
Referential integrity between id fields (`Feature.id`,
`Datum.referenced_feature_id`, `FeatureControlFrame.feature_id`) is
intentionally not enforced yet, for the same reason.

## Tooling

| Concern       | Tool         | Config location         |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Packaging     | Hatchling    | `pyproject.toml`         |
| Domain models | Pydantic v2  | `pyproject.toml` (dependency), `src/gdt_coach/models/` |
| Linting       | Ruff         | `pyproject.toml`         |
| Formatting    | Ruff format  | `pyproject.toml`         |
| Type checking | Mypy (strict)| `pyproject.toml`         |
| Testing       | Pytest       | `pyproject.toml`         |
| Git hooks     | pre-commit   | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`|
| CI            | GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Entry points

- `gdt_coach.cli:main` is registered as the `gdt-coach` console script.
  It currently only supports `--version` and `--help`.

## Decisions to be made

- Parsing approach (source format(s) for drawings, and how they map
  onto `gdt_coach.models`).
- Rule engine design (how it consumes a `Drawing` and where cross-model
  referential integrity gets checked).
- Data storage / persistence approach, if any.

Update this document as real architecture decisions are made.
